Football Management Game using postgresql (with supabase) as backend and flutter as frontend, all in open source
Inspired by Hattrick and Football Manager, the goal is to be more realistic and dynamic than Hattrick and being able to play online on the computer and phone (compared to Football Manager)

## Reasons to make this game

HT is not really realistic, you need to chose what to train, that's not what happens in real life.

Multiple game speeds:

- Speed1 : 1 game per weak (default)

- Speed2: 2 games per weak

- Speed7: 7 games per weak (1 per day)

- Speed14: 14 games per weak (2 per day)

## TODO

### Default teamcomps (EASY)

Possiblity of setting multiple default teamcomps

### Young Players Management (LONG)

Find an idea for example each league and country spawn young players and then bidding between clubs to get them (with money and points from their rankings)

### Money Management (LONG)

Find an idea for recycling money in a closed loop. Salaries and expenses would be split and returned to the clubs according to their rankings

### Display Events of Current Games according to time (NORMAL)

### Game Simulation Extra Cases (EASY)

Handle injuries, subs and free kick

### Log players events (for example goals, injuries) (EASY)

### Handle training and staff (HARD)
